# 2026-02-06

- User (Sebastijan) defined a persistent multi-agent "Uchiha Dev Team" concept.
- Confirmed roster (7):
  - Madara Uchiha — Project Lead / Team Lead (main session)
  - Itachi Uchiha — Overwatch / Security Lead
  - Shisui Uchiha — Architect / Systems Design
  - Sasuke Uchiha — Frontend Lead
  - Fugaku Uchiha — Backend Lead
  - Obito Uchiha — DevOps / Platform
  - Izuna Uchiha — QA / Test Engineering
- User requested we remember this team as the standing team going forward.

- Budget constraint: 0€ / month ongoing cost for now; once project generates money, reinvest into tools/models/hardware (e.g., stronger GPU).
- User intends to reinvest profits into improving the build environment (more RAM/memory) to help future development capacity.
- User requested: if blocked >10 minutes, either push a small progress commit or message with the exact blocker + a yes/no question; avoid stalling.
- Process change (must follow): use GitHub status labels (`status:todo|in-progress|blocked|done`), assign + comment "Started" on issue start; if blocked >10 min label `status:blocked` and ping user.
- Additional rule: after closing an issue, immediately start the next planned issue (assign + status:in-progress + Started comment) unless blocked.
